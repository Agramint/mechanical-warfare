# Mechanical Warfare
Mechanical Warfare is a Mindustry mod adding brand new units, mechs, and turrets. Not for the faintest of engines.

### Features:
- New items and liquids (with the respective crafters)
- Powerful units, ships, and mechs
- New turrets as a mean of defense against the new enemies
- 4 challenging campaign zones with new environment tiles

Please be aware that _this mod is still under heavy development._ Expect more features to be added regularly!
