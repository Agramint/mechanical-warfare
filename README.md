# Mechanical Warfare
Mechanical Warfare is a Mindustry mod adding brand new units, mechs, and turrets. Not for the faintest of engines.

Additions:
- 5 new items and 3 new liquids (with the respective crafters)
- Several new environment tiles
- 2 new powerful turrets (with custom sounds!)
- 1 new unit + 1 new boss
- 3 new campaign zones
- 1 new nuclear reactor

Changes:
- Vanilla turrets and buildings can accept new items and liquids

Please be aware that _this mod is still under heavy development._ Expect more features to be added regularly!

Cheers,
JerichoFletcher & GlennFolker
