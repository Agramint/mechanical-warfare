# Mechanical Warfare
Mechanical Warfare is a Mindustry mod adding brand new units, mechs, and turrets. Not for the faintest of engines.

Additions:
- 5 new items + 3 new liquids (with the respective crafters) mostly compatible with vanilla blocks & turrets
- Several new environment tiles
- 2 new powerful turrets (with custom sounds!)
- 1 new unit + 1 new boss
- 3 new campaign zones

Please be aware that _this mod is still under heavy development._ Expect more features to be added regularly!

Cheers,
JerichoFletcher & GlennFolker
